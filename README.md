# The DSKY-matic Project
### A Full-Scale Funtioning DSKY Replica

### Why is it called "DSKY-matic"?

Because *"Riley Rainey's Apollo Guidance Computer DSKY Replica Project"* doesn't really roll off the tongue.

Naming a project is typically difficult. In this case, it's especially hard, given that a number of interesting open and commercial replicas of the original Apollo Guidance Computer hardware have appeared over the years. I created this project almost entirely for my own gratification. I wanted to create a replica of the original DSKY that was faithful to the original look and feel. An I wanted to be able to interact with it.  This is the result.
