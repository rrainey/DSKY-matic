## Off-the-shelf Components

Screws, washers, and threaded inserts are used to asseble the DSKY. I have tried to stick with screws similar to those used in the original DSKY.  These will cost more, but add to the realism of the project.

## Mounting Hardware Parts

Inserts are used with the two mounting base legs and the Pi mounting bracket. I install ultrasonic style inserts using a C-clamp to screw-down each insert into place.
